# Metronomer 
Are you a musician? If so, you probably know what a metronome is. For those unfamiliar, a metronome is "a device used by musicians that marks time at a selected rate by giving a regular tick." Basically, it helps you determine how long each note should last. For some context, I'm a violinist ðŸŽ». I have been looking for an ad-free, bare-bones metronome app for my personal practice. I was unable to find a decent option, so I built my own metronome app, Metronomer! To build the app, I used HTML, CSS, and JS. The unique part of this project is the built-in JS Oscilator package, which actually makes the sound. Everything else is pretty simple and self-explanatory. I used Capacitor.js to convert my web app into native Android and iOS apps. You can view the app at: https://metronomer.netlify.app/.
